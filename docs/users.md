# Music-matcher users
## Lucía Manson
Lucía is a 19 y/o woman that's currently studying Chemistry at the UGR. She'd like to use `music-matcher` with her smartphone to meet new people in the city she has recently moved to.
Since she doesn't have a very powerful smartphone, she'd like the application to be browser-based and pretty lightweight.

## Jorge Joestar
Jorge Joestar is a 50 y/o music promoter that lives in Granada. After the pandemic, it has become very difficult to put on new shows, and the few that he was able to prepare haven't been very profitable. Because of that, he'd like to use `music-matcher` to try to maximize the possibilities of setting up successful shows.
Jorge is very busy and travels a lot because of his job, and he uses his iPhone for almost everything, but he is not a very technical user, so he needs `music-matcher` to give him straight-to-the-point reports in an easy way.

## Luis Javier
Luis Javier is a 21 y/o PHP developer from Granada who has been lonely lately. Music is crucial to him, and he'd like to meet someone that shares that interest to start a romantic relationship.
He **is** a technical user, so he won't have any trouble with using the application across multiple devices, and he'd even be up to make a PR if there's an interesting feature that he'd like to have implemented.

## Daniel Sanz
Daniel is a 30 y/o waiter from Granada who plays drums in a rock band. Whenever he isn't working or practicing with his band, he enjoys his time listening to music on Spotify. He have been using that music streaming service for years now because of its afordable price, its sound quality, and its recommendation algorithms.

## Sandra
Sandra is a 20 y/o Business Administration student. She uses an iPad to make her assignments and use her social media, and she likes to meet new people frequently. She has a growing interest in Spanish indie music, and she'd like to meet people that enjoy that same type of music.
