# Music-matcher
Connect with people based on your music tastes.

## Description
If you'd like to attend a show of a band that none of your friends is into, if you feel like meeting a special one who also **loves** that track, or if you just want to get to know new people that enjoy the same bands as you, *music-matcher* is here to help you out.

From your Spotify listening history, *music-matcher* will suggest people who will also be eager to meet you.
